# Employee Satisfaction Model

A model to predict if the employee is satisfied or not, depending on some attributes.

# Source of the data:

- A data set from [Find Open Datasets and Machine Learning Projects | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

- Supervised data

# Used Algorithms:

- KNN
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree

# About The Program:

- Data preprocessed at first
- Algorithms folder contains each algorithm with the main
- Each algorithm was built as a function that accept and return output
- The [main.py](http://main.py) file has the required code handling each algorithm function
- The user can interact with the program to enter the data he want from GUI built with Tkinter
- The user can show prediction of any algorithm he wants
- The [main.py](http://main.py) is the start point of the program
